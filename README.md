# NYC Crime in 2020

In 2020, New York City witnessed some of the worse rises in gun violence in the past 14 years according to our analysis. A recent shooting of three innocent bystanders on May 8, 2021, suggests this problem is still urgent and needs to be addressed immediately. By analyzing crime by New York neighborhood, a trend emerged of which neighborhoods are affected the most by a particular crime. This was done by matching each 2020 NYPD crime complaint and shooting incident latitude and longitude location with a zip code and modified zip code tabulation area using python; this determined the neighborhood the crime was committed. Crime per 1,000 people was then determined by aggregating this data by neighborhood and plotting these statistics in a tableau dashboard. This dashboard also included a 2020 trend and ranking of each neighborhood with the ability to filter for a certain crime. The findings revealed that crimes like gun violence are clustered in certain neighborhoods like in Brooklyn. This analysis is a crucial first step for the NYPD and community organizations to understand which neighborhoods are in dire need of early support and intervention. Further research should consider other factors like demographics, education, or access to essential services, and determine if providing early outreach and support to afflicted communities have a greater overall crime reduction in NYC.
